# Samudragupta Barma

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a Engeneering Student, and I enjoy building projects with python. Here, you’ll find some of my best work.

## Projects

### [Project 1: WhatsApp Chat Summarizer](https://github.com/samudra-07/whatsapp-chat-summeraizer)
A Python tool that analyzes and summarizes WhatsApp chat data.

- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Numpy,gensim
- **Description**: A tool that processes exported WhatsApp chat files and provides summaries, statistics, and insights.

### [Project 2: Emotion Detection Using Facial Expression](https://github.com/samudra-07/emotion-detection-using-facial-expression)
The system utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to analyze facial expressions and predict the corresponding emotions.

- **Technologies**: Python,JSON,OpenCV
- **Description**: The system uses a deep learning architecture, typically a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a combination of CNN and recurrent neural network (RNN), to extract features from facial images. These features are then passed through fully connected layers for emotion prediction.
